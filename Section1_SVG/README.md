1. Exercise1.html specifies an SVG element - right now it's a square with *equal* width and height. It also has some style elements associated with it (a little vaporwave). You should:

- Make it a rectangle
- Change the colors so the border is pink and the inside is a mint green. 

2. The second exercise presents a circle.

- Double its radius.

3. Exercise 3.html shows an SVG line element. Flip it. That is, edit the SVG code so it instead of starting at the top left and moving to the bottom right, it starts at the bottom left and moves to the top right.

(*hint* : it may have something to do with those coordinate arguments 🤔 )
